# Lazy and parallel bio-image processing using DASK

When images take too long to load or process, or donâ€™t fit into memory, they can be split up and managed in small parts. This practical is about easily gaining control over which parts of a (bio-)image are processed when and where in the context of interactive python workflows, napari and cluster computing.

## Preparation

To get started, we need to install/activate a suitable conda environment:

### Option 1:

Use the environment created in the [course preparation](
https://biapol.github.io/PoL-BioImage-Analysis-TS-GPU-Accelerated-Image-Analysis/00_course_preparation/Readme.html) and install some further packages to it:

```
mamba activate devbio-napari-env
mamba install -c conda-forge dask-image ipycytoscape
```

### Option 2:

Create a new environment from scratch:

```
mamba create --name <dask_course> python=3.9 devbio-napari pyqt dask-image ipycytoscape -c conda-forge
mamba activate dask_course
```
