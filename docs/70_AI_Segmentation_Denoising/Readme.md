# AI segmentation and denoising

Welcome to the session on segmentation on segmentation and denoising using deep learning. This tutorial will pick up where the previous session on pytorch left off. This tutoorial will cover several topics:

* [Training a Unet for segmentation](./01_2D_unet_training.ipynb): The [Unet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0261-2) was and is *the* working horse architecture for the segmentation of image data across all possible domains.
* [Denoising image data with Noise2Void](./02_Noise2Void.ipynb): [Noise2Void](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Krull_Noise2Void_-_Learning_Denoising_From_Single_Noisy_Images_CVPR_2019_paper.html) and its update, [Probabilistic Noise2Void](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2020.00005/full) are poerful tools for denoising any image data without the need for ground truth data.
