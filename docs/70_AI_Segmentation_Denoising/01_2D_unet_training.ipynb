    "The first thing we have to do for Pytorch training, is tpo create a custom `Dataset` class for our dataset. This dataset object will then serve as a utility through which Pytorch can access and load all the data from the drive. During the training process we will iterate over our dataset, so the `Dataset` implementation needs to have two important member functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__len__()`: The Dataloader needs to know how *many* samples there are.\n",
    "* `__getitem__()`: The Dataloader needs to be able to access the i-th sample out of our whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will create a pandas dataframe with two columns `image` and `mask` and pass this to the Dataset. Working with dataframes is particularly easy because it allows us to easily split our data into a training and a validation cohort.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note 1*: We will add the option for augmentation to the datafly. If we pass an augmentation function as an argument (which should accept parameters `image` and `mask` as inputs), the augmentations are applied on-the-fly. We will use the [albumentations package](https://albumentations.ai/) for this.\n",
    "*Note 2*: We will use a pretrained model. Such pretrained models are typically implemented for \"normal\" images, i.e. RGB images. Hence, the used model expects images to have the dimensions `[3, Y, X]`. Thus, if we work with grayscale images, we need to stack the single channel we are working with 3 times to create an artifical RGB image."

After all, deep learning is all about passing data through the network, evaluating the performance and then changing the weights accordingly. The loss function determines how exactlly performance is measured. Torch offers a few different implementations but you can basically implement any metric that compares two label images and calculates something like a degree of similarity. Something that is very commonly used (and thus being used here) is the `CrossEntropyLoss()` function, which calculates the cross-entropy of two label images. The [CrossEntropy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) is closely related to the [Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy).\n",

During the training we should observe that the cross-entropy in the training process goes down while the Jaccard-index should converge closer to 1."

    "## Advanced implementation aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few options we can to improve the training process and make it more robust. Some of them are listed here and will be expored in more advanced notebooks for the sake of this notebook's simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early Stopping:** We have implemented a naive way of stopping the training process if the model is good enough. However, to effectively prevent overfitting, we need to stop the training process as soon as performance is not improving anymore. Thus, a more suitable early stopping implementation would have to look at the train/test performance scores within the last X epochs and check if the variance of performance scores has been small. If so, the training process will be interrupted.\n",
    "* **Weighted sampling**: If we want to segmented regions in the image, which are rare in our training data, any well-behaving network should lean towards not predicting such labels *at all*. After all, the error in prediction is small if these labels are sufficiently scarce. To counter this, we can introduce [weighted sampling](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.WeightedRandomSampler) to ensure that the network is equally exposed to all present labels in the image data.\n",
    "* **Scheduling**: As the model converges closer to its optimum, it is not wise to keep updating the model at the same speed as during the first epochs. We can do this by changing the `learning_rate` parameter as we progress through the epochs. Thus, the steps become smaller and safer. See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/marktenenholtz/status/1490309316347248646) for a nice visualization.\n",
    "* **Visualization**: It is good practice to visualize the training process through a side-by-side comparison of reference annotation and predicted label image."
